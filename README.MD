## How does an API work ?
---
###  An API works as a mediator between two applications, allowing them to communicate with each other. Here's a basic overview of how it works:
1. **Request**
A client application sends a request to the API
The request usually includes:
The API endpoint (a specific URL)
The method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
Headers (additional information about the request)
Sometimes, a body (data sent with the request)


2. **Processing**
The API receives the request and processes it
This might involve:
Authenticating the request
Validating the data
Performing the requested operation (like fetching data from a database)


3. **Response**
After processing, the API sends back a response
This typically includes:
A status code (indicating success, failure, etc.)
Response headers
The requested data (usually in a format like JSON or XML)


4. **Client-side Handling**
The client application receives the response and processes it accordingly


This process allows different software systems to interact and share data, even if they're built with different technologies or run on different platforms.
